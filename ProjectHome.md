Yet another graduation project of mine.

It's intention is to build a simple framework that will enable us to compare the performance of different web-page-categorization algorithms (I don't know yet, which I will use :)).

The structure is the following:

  * [database](database.md) - holds all the data;
  * [fetcher](fetcher.md) - fetches web pages from the network;
  * **some intelligent module** - categorizes pages;
  * **some other module** - issues commands.
